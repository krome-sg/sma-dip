 Foo Piao Xu (Fu Biaoxu)

She has enjoyed considerable success working across the whole spectrum of television production, from conceptualising new ideas to content creation and distribution. She has worked with numerous directors, writers, producers, above-the-line and below-the-line production resource staff, and clients in the media industry.
She is the Executive Producer (in charge of production) of 'Fighting Spiders'. This English drama series won the Special Award for Best Mini-Series at the Seoul Drama International Drama Awards 2009. She is also the Producer of 80s Rewind, the situational comedy that won the Silver World Medal (situational comedy) in the New York Festivals International TV Programming and Promotion Awards 2009.

 Foo Tiang Khuen, Juan
Juan produced Singapore’s first digital film, ‘Return To Pontianak’ (1999), the first HD feature ‘Dirty Laundry’ (2001), and the indie-cult film ‘Perth’ (2005). His film journey began in script reading and distribution for a film finance company, then freelancing in editing and production. 
Graduating from film school and holding qualifications in creative producing and creative entrepreneurship, Juan also trained in traditional cel animation and worked briefly in Japanese anime. As a producer, Juan developed and raised project funds up to S$1M. His instinct and work in story development led to script option offers by a Hollywood studio. In the 2000s, Juan was one of the first few Asian filmmakers to workshop projects in European labs like Produire-Au-Sud. He was associate producer for other indie-Singapore films such as ‘Road Less Travelled’ (1997), ‘Talking Cock The Movie’ (2002), and ‘Unarmed Combat’ (2005). He developed the bubble tea comedy 'One Thousand Cups to Midnight' (2020). During Covid, Juan produced Singapore's first creature monster film, 'Circle Line' (2023).
In addition to lecturing in film institutions, Juan is an industry moderator, jury, and writer. Juan worked in WDA, MDA, and U Creative in talent development, content quality assessment, and outreach. He is candidly regarded as the pioneer independent producer who is “still” around for the past 20 years.
