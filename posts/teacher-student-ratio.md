At the Singapore Media Academy, we have highly qualified and competent trainers with relevant industry experience to deliver lessons to our students every year. It is our aim and commitment to provide necessary academic support and assistance to help our students succeed. We keep our teacher: student ratios small because we believe that this will enhance the learning experience of our students.Tertiary Education Programmes1:80 (Lecture)1:26 (Tutorial)1:26 (Seminar Style)
